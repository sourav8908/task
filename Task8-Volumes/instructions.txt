🎯 Objective:
Demonstrate difference between container storage, Docker volumes, and host-mounted volumes — and verify persistence behavior.
⚙️ Instructions / Specifications:
1️⃣ Container Storage (Temporary)
•	Image → ubuntu:latest
•	Container → temp-storage-demo
•	Create file → /data/tempfile.txt
•	Remove container and recreate → file disappears.
2️⃣ Docker Volume (Persistent)
•	Volume Name → my_volume
•	Container → volume-storage-demo
•	Mount → my_volume:/appdata
•	Create file → /appdata/persistent.txt
•	Recreate container using same volume → file should still exist.
3️⃣ Host Mount (Bind Mount)
•	Host Folder → /home/user/docker_data or C:\docker_data
•	Container → bind-mount-demo
•	Mount → Host folder ↔ /mnt/data
•	Create file hostfile.txt and verify live sync between host and container.
✅ Expected Output:
•	docker volume ls shows my_volume
•	Data inside my_volume remains after removal
•	Host mount sync verified both directions
•	Volume inspect shows mount path (e.g., /var/lib/docker/volumes/my_volume/_data)
