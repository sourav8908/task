Pull the official MySQL image from Docker Hub.

Run it in a detached container named mysql-test.

Expose port 3306 to the host system.

Use the following environment variables while running the container:

MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD = my-secret-pw

MYSQL_DATABASE = devops

Verify itâ€™s running using docker ps.

View container logs to confirm MySQL started correctly.

Stop and remove both the container and image.
